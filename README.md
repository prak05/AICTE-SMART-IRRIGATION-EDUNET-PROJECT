# AICTE-SMART-IRRIGATION-EDUNET-PROJECT
This project uses sensor data to predict irrigation needs for three parcels. The Irrigation_System.ipynb notebook covers data loading, preprocessing (MinMaxScaler), training a MultiOutputClassifier with RandomForestClassifier, and evaluation. It aims to optimize water use and support automated irrigation decisions.
